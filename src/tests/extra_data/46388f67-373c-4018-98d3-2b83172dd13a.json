    "description": "Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Fluid Relay server. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but CMKs are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you, with full control and responsibility, including rotation and management.
